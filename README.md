# Akash Community Marketing Team Proposal

## Introduction

After seeing many great features being released on Akash such as GPUs, easy-to-use CI/CD workflows, and fiat/trial funds, we feel like the time is right to start marketing the network, its platforms and tools, to the masses. We want to explore creating a focused and skilled marketing team for Akash that will focus very broadly. Examples include: posts on X/Reddit/Medium, sponsored videos where Akash is used, sponsoring small deployments in exchange for banners (game servers, web tools), helping create integrations to Akash, and creating smaller programs within the program such as "Deployment/Contribution of the month." 

## Expected outcomes

- Attempting to collaborate with the Events 2025 Proposal to have an IRL presence of the team at many events. The main goal is to enable us to make assessments directly whether or not we can make something happen in regards to marketing. A secondary goal for this is to help users and companies to get in touch with Navigators from the newly improved Community Programs Proposal to help them get started with Akash and integrate their products. The contributors can also contribute normally through the events proposal by e.g. helping at the booth or hosting a workshop.
- Helping different platforms promote their new features that can be used by the masses (e.g. Akash Console with their recent CI/CD tool once this is out of beta) through sponsoring a relevant YouTube channel to create a video on it. The goal of this is to increase the number of unique developers deploying their own applications on Akash.
- Creating posts on different platforms (X, Reddit, Medium) with different fun and informative text. Examples include: conducting thought experiments, making comparisons, creating new templates for communities to use, stress testing, and more. The goal of this is to make Akash something people recognize over time and help out in other communities where there is no good standardized way of running their tools.
- Conversing with people on X spaces. Each meeting will have different goals.
- And more! We can't compile a list with key figures without guessing anyways and we are open for ideas. The above we will focus on the most but what we mentioned in the introduction and other ideas will likely be relevant in this proposal.

## Resources required

> 3x contributors @ $1000/contributor/month
> 
> Marketing budget @ $5000/month
>
> The possibility of collaborating with other proposals such as the Community Activies Proposal to create bounties where it makes sense for the two proposals

The contributors for the first proposal are: Rodri (technical role and responsible for financials), PiberDev (program lead and technical role), and Robert (non-technical role and social advisor). All of these contributors have attended events representing Akash in the past, and all of these contributors are also long-term Insiders/Vanguards.

For the contributor pay we are starting with the numbers found above and will potentially adjust with any appropriate changes before the next proposal.

## Proposal funding

We are requesting 4 months worth of funding starting in December, totaling $32000 USD worth of AKT. No overages will be included but contributor pays will be prioritized in case of extreme volatility.
