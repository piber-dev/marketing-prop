# Akash Community Marketing Team Proposal

## Introduction

After seeing many great features being released on Akash such as GPUs, easy-to-use CI/CD workflows, and fiat/trial funds, we feel like the time is right to start marketing the network, its platforms and tools, to the masses. We want to explore creating a focused and skilled marketing team for Akash that will focus very broadly. Examples include: posts on X/Reddit/Medium, sponsored videos where Akash is used, sponsoring small deployments in exchange for banners (game servers, web tools), helping create integrations to Akash by reaching out and assisting with any technical concerns, and creating smaller programs within the program such as "Deployment/Contribution of the month." 

## Expected outcomes

- Attempting to collaborate with the Events 2025 Proposal to have an IRL presence of the team at many events.
- 

## Resources required

> 3x contributors @ $1000/contributor/month
> 
> Marketing budget @ $5000/month

The contributors for the first proposal are: Rodri (technical role and responsible for financials), PiberDev (program lead and technical role), and Robert (non-technical role and social advisor).

For the contributor pay, we are starting with the numbers found above and will make appropriate changes before the next proposal.

## Proposal funding

We are requesting 4 months worth of budget starting in December, totaling $32000 USD worth of AKT. No overages will be included but contributor pays will be prioritized.
